# User Authentication API

This is a simple user authentication API built with Express.js and MongoDB. It provides endpoints for user signup and login, and uses JWT for authentication.

## Features

- User Signup: Register a new user with a nickname and password.
- User Login: Authenticate an existing user with a nickname and password.
- Password Hashing: Passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt.
- JWT Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used for session management.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rohit2216/wysa.git
   cd wysa
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) installed. Then, install the necessary npm packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following environment variables:

   ```
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost/your_database
   ```

   Replace `your_jwt_secret` with a secret key for signing JWTs and `mongodb://localhost/your_database` with your MongoDB connection string.

4. **Run the Server**

   Start the server using:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The server will run on `http://localhost:5000` by default.
